Nodes and edges:as composing a network, we need two inputs, one is a list of the actors and the other one is a list of the relations (the interactions between actors). Usually, we call the actors as nodes and the relations as edges in Gephi.
 In my eyes, Nodes are people and the edges show that one person is following another. As my network graph shown, all the red vertices, such as  Jenifer and Vasanth are the nodes and the red lines are edges which denote the relationship among each other.
Bridging: means the nodes and edges that connect across different groups
 . In my graph, there are five groups which are shown as different kinds of colors. The edges between different color groups are bridges, such as the edges between Shobana in blue group and Vishnu in green group, Manikandan in purple group and Rangaswamy in green group, which facilitate inter-group communication,as well as  increases social cohesion.
bonding,in my opinion is something related to relationship strength tie, specifically for social relations. It can be the frequency of interaction ( communication ) or the amount of flow( exchange ); the type of interaction or flow between the two parties.
 Degreecentrality,is the number of links that lead into or out of the node, Which is often used as measure of a node’s degree of connectedness and also influence or popularity. In social networks, it means how many people can reach this person directly.
 . For example, Saranya has 4 degrees and Santhosh only has 2 degrees.  Degree is useful in assessing which nodes are central with respect to spreading information and influencing other’s in their immediate ‘neighborhood’.
Betweenness centrality: calculate the number of shortest paths between two different nodes that pass through a certain one, showing which nodes are more likely to be in communication paths between other nodes. It is also useful in determining points where the network would break apart. In social network, it means how likely this person is to be the most direct route between two people. For example, in my graph,  Karthk has higherbetweenness centrality than Santhosh, which means Karthk is more likely to be the most direct route between two people in the network than Santhosh.
Closeness centrality, calculate the mean length of all shortest paths from a node to all other nodes in the network. Like the other measures of centrality, the higher values are better (indicate higher closeness), because we take the reciprocal of the mean value. It is a measure of reach, for example, the speed with which information can reach other nodes from a given starting node.That is how fast this person can reach everyone in the network
.  In my graph, Vivek obviously has a higher closeness centrality than Saleen, which means the speed of information from Vivek to other people is quicker than Saleen.
Eigen-vector centrality,a node’s eigenvector centrality is proportional to the sum of the eigenvector centralities of all nodes directly connected to it. In other words, a node with a high eigenvector centrality is connected to other nodes with high eigenvector centrality. It is useful in determining who is connected to the most connected nodes. In other words, it means how well is this person connected to other well-connected people.

  Take part of my graph for example, Babu has the highest eigenvector ,followed by Arun and Harsh. That means Babu is better than Arun who connected to other well-connected people.
